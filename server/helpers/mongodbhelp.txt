i had to do this:
	- download mongodb from website
	- create the directory "data" in C:/
	- move contents from c:/program files/mongodb bin to the "data" directory
	- on "data" create a subdirectory with the name of your mongo database... in this case "ate"
	- open a CMD prompt on C:/data
	- start the mongodb server by doing "mongod --dbpath ate" ... replace "ate" with the database name you want
